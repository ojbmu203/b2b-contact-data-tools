## **FAQ**

**How do I avoid getting my LinkedIn account restricted when using prospecting tools?**

Choose cloud-based tools with dedicated IPs like Expandi or Dripify that mimic human behavior through randomized actions and timing delays. Limit connection requests to 50-100 weekly maximum and avoid sending identical messages. Tools like Dux-Soup and PhantomBuster include built-in safety features preventing spam detection. Maintain natural activity—don't run automation 24/7, and manually engage with content between automated sessions. If using browser-based tools, keep daily limits conservative and vary your prospecting times.

**What's the difference between free and paid plans for contact data tools?**

Free plans typically offer 5-50 credits monthly for testing (like Kaspr's 5 emails and 5 phones, or Hunter's 25 searches), sufficient for occasional prospecting but not regular use. Paid plans provide significantly higher limits (hundreds to unlimited contacts), access to phone numbers alongside emails, CRM integrations, bulk exports, and priority support. Free tiers often lack advanced features like intent data, email verification, and enrichment capabilities. For consistent B2B prospecting, paid plans justify costs through time savings and higher data quality.

**Can I use multiple prospecting tools together, or will that create duplicate efforts?**

Combining complementary tools often works better than relying on one platform. Use Sales Navigator or PhantomBuster for targeted prospect identification, then Kaspr or Hunter for contact extraction, and finally Overloop or LaGrowthMachine for outreach automation. Ensure your CRM deduplicates contacts to prevent multiple outreach to the same person. Many successful teams use a prospecting stack: one tool for research, another for data enrichment, and a third for engagement. The key is clear workflow definition so tools enhance rather than duplicate each other's functions.
